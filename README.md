# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description

This is a code refactoring of the Horiseon website landing page. The goals of this project were to make the page ADA compliant and to clean up and condense the code, while maintaining the same look on the front end. In order to make this happen, the following tasks were completed: 

	1. Added semantic HTML elements.
	2. Ensured the elements followed a logical structure.
	3. Added alt text to all images and logos.
	4. Added comments to the HTML and CSS files for clarity.
	5. Ensured all links were working.
	6. Added a concise and descriptive title element.

By meeting these goals, this webpage will now experience an improvement in function, accessibility, search engine optimization, and the code is easier to read and understand. I learned more about the importance of accessibility, both in meeting ADA standards and in creating code that can be easily understood.
